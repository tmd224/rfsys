# Netlist schema
# Lines starting with a # are a comma and will be ignored
# netlist schema is in the following form
# RefDes-UID.Port;RefDes-UID.Port
# The left hand component is the input and the right hand component(s) are the output
# RefDes is a unique reference designator for the component
# UID is a unique component identifier from the component XML definition
# Multiple RefDes can use the same UID (ie multiple instances of the same component definition)
# The port is the component port number.  Most devices will have 1 as input and 2 as output.
# For P > 2, refer to component documentation for port enumerations
# Multiple connections are possible:
# U1-LNA1.2;R1-R10K.1;C1-C100PF.1
# In this example, the output of an LNA goes to a 10K resistor and to a 100pF cap
